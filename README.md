# eventhub-qpid-example

This repo has a minimal example for connecting to Azure Event Hubs
(<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-hubs/>) over the AMQP
protocol
(<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-amqp-protocol-guide>)
using Apache Qpid (<https://qpid.apache.org/>).

The command line application itself is written in Java and Spring Boot, though
this is unlikely to be important.

The example itself is licensed under the MIT license.
